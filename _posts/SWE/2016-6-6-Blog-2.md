<h3>MORE Apex Action</h3>   
***  
  So, to build on last week's post about ```apex:actionRegion```, I have been working with another apex tag called ```apex:actionStatus```. I have found a blog that goes into more detail about it's functionalities and shows 3 examples of ```apex:actionStatus``` in use. The original blog is [here](http://sfdcsrini.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-to-use-apexactionstatus-tag-in.html). 
  
  There are three examples on the blog about different times you may use an apex:actionStatus tag, but the one I found most suitable for my needs was the third example. The page was enough information for me to complete my task and is probably good enough if you know what you're doing with visualforce/salesforce and the actionStatus tag. However, I need more writing practice so here's another tutorial.
  
  I'm starting off assuming you have the following:   
  
  * A basic visualforce page with some kind of content and a 'submit' or 'continue' button.
  ..* exampleCheckout.vfp
  ..* The button attribute ```action``` set equal to a function defined in the controller.
  * A basic custom visualforce page controller.
  ..* exampleCheckoutController.apex
  ..* A processing function of some sort defined for the button action.
  * A [gif](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSu__J9cr1U) from [http://www.ajaxload.info/](http://www.ajaxload.info/) for your loading icon
