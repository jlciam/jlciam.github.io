 __:question: Questions :question:__  
 *1. What did you do this past week?*   
     This past week my team did their presentation and I took the final exam. I made it to the end!   
 *2. What's in your way?*   
     There's currently just waiting for the final grades to come in...   
 *3. What will you do next week?*   
     Since after tomorrow I have no more assignments or finals to complete, I'll start going to work and enjoying the extra time off before summer classes.

    Well, it's the end of the semester and once again it surprises me how fast the time flies by. I definitely enjoyed the lectures from this class and will miss Downing's excitement.   
    
   
 <h3> Major :key: </h3>   
  Nvidia has released a new graphics card I'm sure my younger brother is dying to get.  Nvidia reports, "GTX 1080 is faster and three times more energy-efficient than the company's current best-in-class graphics card, the Titan X" (Nvidia)[http://www.geforce.com/hardware/10series/geforce-gtx-1080]
