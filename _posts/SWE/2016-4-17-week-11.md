__:question: Questions :question:__  
*1. What did you do this past week?*   
    This past week our team checked out the other team's website. We learned from looking at their project that we could do more detailed searches and were able to improve ours.   
*2. What's in your way?*   
    Turning in Project #5 and getting ready to do our presentation. 
*3. What will you do next week?*   
    I'm going to continue trying to get better quiz grades. We'll also be preparing to our presentations. I'll probably spend time looking over our google doc and examples shown in class in order to get ready for the upcoming exam.          
***   
The end of the semester seems really near. We only have the project #5 to turn in and then our presentations. We do have the final exam to worry about, but I think I should be prepared after the quizzes.

<h3> Major :key: </h3>   
  Over the weekend Rust made an update that randomly assigns gender to a player based on their SteamID. Some people are upset, but it's made me interested in checking out the game myself. If you're interested in reading more about it, you can check it out [this article](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/11/11408502/rust-random-female-avatars)
